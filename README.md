KM_theory_S_K_with_surface_reflection_correction.m file is a function to calculate S and K of a random media using reflectivity (R) and transmissivity (T) values simulated in any exact electromagnetic solver.
Extracting_S_K_from_R_T_values_for_KM_theory.m is the main file where inputs of R and T will be given. It will give S and K values of the random media.
Calculation_of_RT_using_KM_with_S_and_K.m will calculate R and T for any higher thickness of the random media using S and K values obtained from Extracting_S_K_from_R_T_values_for_KM_theory.m code.
